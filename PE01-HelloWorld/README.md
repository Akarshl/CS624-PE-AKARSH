This React Native program does not take any user input. Instead, it consists of text values representing a personâ€™s name, degree program, and school. These text messages are defined using <Text> components. The background color and layout styling are also defined in the code using the StyleSheet API .

When the application runs, react native core components are loaded. The program uses one <View> to serve as a container for three <Text> components. A StyleSheet object named styles is used to center the content both vertically and horizontally and apply a yellow background to the entire screen. React then renders the app UI using these specifications.

The output is a simple mobile screen displaying three lines of text: the name - Akarsh Lakshmana the degree program - MSCS and the school - STC all centered on a yellow background.
