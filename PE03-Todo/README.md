The application receives input from the user through a text input field where tasks can be typed in. Each task is added when the user presses the submit button. The input is captured in the input value state and used to create a new todo object.

When a task is submitted, it is added to the todos array in the component's state with a unique identifier and a complete status set to false. The app can filter tasks based on status: All, Active, or Complete. Users can mark tasks as complete/incomplete or delete them. These changes update the applicationâ€™s state, which triggers a re-render to reflect the changes.

The output is a dynamic list of todos displayed on the screen. Each task shows its title and associated buttons for marking as done/undo or deleting. Tabs allow filtering the displayed tasks by their completion status.
