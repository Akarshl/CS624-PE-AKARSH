The app takes a single user input using the TextInput component, where users can type their favorite course. The input field is clearly labeled and supports real-time text entry. This interaction personalizes the experience, making the app more engaging and user-focused.

Upon launch, the app loads a local image and renders structured text content organized into categories: Core Requirements, Depth of Study, and Capstone courses. It uses a functional component with React Native core elements such as View, Text, Image, ScrollView, and StyleSheet for layout and styling. The app maintains internal state to track user input via the useState hook. All components are styled internally and arranged to be responsive and scrollable.

The output is a clean, scrollable mobile interface displaying the course information visually grouped into colored sections. It includes a logo, an input box for user interaction, and a list of categorized MSCS courses.
